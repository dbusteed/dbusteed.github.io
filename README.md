# Basic Portfolio Website

this website lists some projects from my GitHub and then has some tags that you can filter on

`utils/grab_repos.py` uses the GitHub API to put a user's repos into the format used by this React app, so if you wanna use this a starting point for your own portfolio site, feel free to give it a try
