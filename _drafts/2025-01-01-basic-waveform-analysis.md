At some point along my DIY electronics journey, I knew I'd probably want to play around with an osciliscope (espcially for [DIY synth](https://dbusteed.github.io/tags/#diy-synth)). But, I'm still not ready for $$$ multichannel workbench scope, so I started to look around for other options.

## Osciloscope

After poking around on AliExpress, I found the FNISRI DSO152 for under $25. There's a DSO138 for cheaper (especially if you buy as a kit), but I felt a sturdy enclosure would be easier to use. Of course a $25 scope from AliExpress is leagues below a proper workbench scope, but for my entry level curiosity and skill level, it seemed like a cheap and user-friendly device.

## Wave Generator

The DSO152 has a built-in 1kHz square wave for calibration, but I was curious to see other waveforms before I get started building more complicated circuits that I can use the scope on. Once again, I started poking around on AliExpress, and found ->

I've grabbed a few of these small soldering practice kits before, and they can be pretty fun to throw something together in an evening. The kit didn't include a power supply, but it needs a DC Positive 9V (and maybe higher?) input, which I had lying around the house. I also add wires coming out the side to make the connection to the scope a bit easier.
