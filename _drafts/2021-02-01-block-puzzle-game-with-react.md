I find it interesting when people use a programming language / framework outside of it's intended use cases. Oftentimes this happens when the developer simply doesn't know any better (we've all been there), but sometimes people just do it for the sake of doing it.

I'm not able to find the link, but I once saw a project on GitHub that was a 3D FPS game writtin with a `.sh` shell script.
