IN PROGRESS!

<!-- In the [previous post](https://dbusteed.github.io/chimera-guitar-pedal-part-1/), I assembled the hardware for my DIY guitar pedal. As opposed to an analog device which solely relies on electronic components to process audio signals, this pedal is digital (thanks Daisy Seed!). This means this project was from over, I still needed to program the digital sound processing and component interfaces. -->

## Conceptual design
