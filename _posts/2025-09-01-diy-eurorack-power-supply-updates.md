Before building more modules, I needed to build a power bus so that my power supply could power multiple modules simultaneously.

## Power Bus

Just like my main power supply, my power bus is very simple. I took a piece of stripboard and soldered a bunch of 16-pin sockets in a row. The power supply will connect to one side, and then each socket will go to the different modules. Done!

## Adding to the Case

With the new bus ready, I velcro-ed the bus and power supply to the back of the case.

Finally, I drilled a hole in the side of the case that lines up nicely with the power supply.

Time to add more modules!
